        <h2>Pizza Hut Worldwide</h2>
        <p>
            In Wichita, brothers Frank and Dan Carney opened the first Pizza Hut restaurant on June 15, 1958. They had been approached by the owner of a small building who wanted a nice neighbourhood business, and had read the Post's article about pizza. The Carneys borrowed $600 from their mother, located John Bender, an airman from McConnell Air Force Base who had worked as a pizza cook, purchased some second-hand equipment and were ready for business. The first night, they gave away pizza to interest potential customers.
            Many people ask how Pizza Hut got its name. When the Carneys were setting up that first restaurant, the building has a sign with room for just nine characters. They wanted to use "pizza" in the name, which left room for a word with only three characters. A family member suggested the building looked like a hut....and Pizza Hut was born.
